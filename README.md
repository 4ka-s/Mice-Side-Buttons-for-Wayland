INSTRUCTIONS AT LAST; BELOW INFORMATION.

DEPENDENCIES:

    [YDOTOOL]

PRE-REQUISITS:

    [USBMON PERMISSIONS]

Works by capturing raw USB packets from usbmon and bind them to yodotool.

INSTRUCTIONS:

    Execute "setup.sh" with root privileges. (do so by opening to the terminal and then navigating to the directory where setup.sh is, most file managers have a open terminal here option and then run "sudo ./setup.sh")
    Execute "register" and lift your mouse up.
    Do not press any button or execute any input through the mouse.
    Count to 5 seconds.
    Press the SIDE mouse button, hold for a second and let go.
    Press the EXTRA mouse button, hold for a second and let go.
    Once your mouse has been registered, you need not do it again once you restart your PC.

Having done so, execute sidebuttons and they should be good to go. It is recommended you tie sidebuttons to a startup service (such as tying it to hyprland) so you need not do it manually everytime.
